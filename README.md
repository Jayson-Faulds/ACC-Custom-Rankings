# ACC-Custom-Rankings
Here I use Python to generate my own rankings for the ACC conference

Here is yet another sports project that I did for fun: I wanted to create my own rankings for the ACC conference for College Basketball's 2018-2019 season. I took a pretty broad approach, not focusing as much on offensive prowess and team statistics but instead looking at their results. My custom ranking takes the following factors into account: win percentage, margin of victory, number of quality wins, number of "bad losses," recent winning percentage (To account for teams getting hot), road winning percentage, and neutral winning percentage (To assess how teams will be in a March Madness setting).

Is it better than the AP rankings?? Maybe.
